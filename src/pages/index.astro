			<h1>🧑‍🚀 Hello, Inventor.</h1>
			<p>
				Embedded systems have gained popularity amongst the masses over the years. In the recent past, this has been accelerated by availability of prototyping boards at all levels, from Arduino to Launchpads to Raspberry Pi and beyond.

				Arduino has been a good example of adoption due to ease of entry and has done the job well. Now, time has come to move on.....move from entry level to advanced programming, move from LED Blinkies to LiFi applications, move from ultrasonic range finding to Time of Flight sensing (of Light !!), move from power guzzlers to Ultra Low power (Power and Forget !!).

				<b>Let us move on with Mispino....</b>an Arduino compatible (Energia based) eco-system developed to bring in new concepts, evolve new use cases and exploit modern sensors & actuators. Let us get down to Rapid Application Development from Rapid Concept Demonstration.
